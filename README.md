# Starbattle in OOP
Here is a new version of The Starbattle game with OOP patterns and better architecture.

Observer - for tracking user input and the state of objects  
Flyweight - for asteroids and other sprites  
Factory Method - for sprites with similar properties  
Decorator - for the gradual improvement of the ship  
Command - for the interface  
Bridge - separation of files into header (.h) and source (.cpp)  
Singleton - for the game window and the main character
